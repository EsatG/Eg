    List : Accepts duplicates, has index number
    Set : does not accept duplicates, does not have index

    Iterable(I): Root interface,
                 Classes that implements iterable,gains the ability to iterate the objects
                 We can apply Iterator(I) to the classes that are implementing Iterable
                 Iterable internally uses Iterator

                 Iterator(I):
                      1. it allows us to get access to each objects of the collections type
                      2. it allows us to remove the objects from collection
                      in order to reomve the objects from collection you have to use iterator

                      iterator(): iterates the any given collection, then returns Iterator interface

                      hasNext():  checks if there are enough elements that can be iterated, it returns boolean

                      next(): if hasNext() condition is true we can use this next() method. This method accesses and retrieves the element

                      remove(): removes the current element of iteration
